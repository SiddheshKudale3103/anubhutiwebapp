# Anubhuti Healing Space â€” React + Vite + Tailwind Starter

This is a ready-to-run React + Vite project scaffolded with Tailwind CSS, pre-populated with content from the user's document (Hero, About, Services, Programs, Workshops, Collaborations, Contact).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes

- This project uses Vite. Tailwind directives are set in `src/index.css`. You need to install the devDependencies locally for Tailwind (see package.json).
- The contact form is a stub that shows an alert â€” replace with your preferred backend or form service (Formspree, Netlify forms, custom API).
- Replace placeholder images and add accessibility attributes as needed.

Happy building! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
